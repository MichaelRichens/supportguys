				{/* TODO don't understand if 1st paragraph is talking about an upgrade to 2nd paragraph, or if 2nd paragraph is the result of 1st paragraph 
				- "what was hoped for" would be better as "all that could be wished" or similar if the former*/}
				<p>
					Initial call out was to connect two sites via a site to site
					short haul data service (SHDS), which had been left as raw
					SPF sockets and told "itâ€™s all working; over to you!" This
					was to replace a site to site VPN, as the central database
					was running slowly for the remote users.
				</p>
				<p>
					Working with 10 year old routers; and networks either side
					which had been bolted onto and expanded and added to and it
					worked; almost. The performance was not what was hoped for.
				</p>
				<p>
					During our time on site other problem areas became apparent.
					Several Macs were running very very slowly as their hard
					drives were failing. A couple of mission critical Macs
					(which were running Parallels for specific software which is
					only available in Windows) were woefully under specified in
					RAM and also had failing hard drives. These were upgraded,
					suitably sized SSDs installed and RAM enough to run a
					virtualised OS and the required software was installed. Data
					was migrated onto the new drives with minimal downtime.
				</p>
				<p>
					A continuing niggle was their database server, which was
					running slow on client machines - lots of end users
					reporting massive delays on changing layouts and general
					use, which the database designer could not fathom as
					everything was optimised on the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					A full site inspection revealed that hubs and switches were
					scattered throughout the factory. Structured cabling was in
					place, but a lack of understanding of topography meant it
					was not used. Bottlenecks were all over the place as all the
					servers were connected to a single 1G connection to the main
					switch.
				</p>
				<p>
					Replacing the switches with larger, managed switches meant
					that each Mac could have its own connection. It also allowed
					the use of Link Aggregation (LAG) to increase the bandwidth
					to the servers and dramatically improve the end user
					experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Replacing the routers with modern ones improved the remote
					site experience too, similar to the local one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Demand for reliable WiFi was made and implemented using
					Ubiquity Access Points, making the WiFi reliable and able to
					cope with increased demand.
				</p>
				<p>
					This has been a year long iteration to uncover and counter
					several deep rooted bottlenecks. The client now has a
					managed network, Macs which are running smoothly, and a
					database which gives them the benefits they need to deliver
					to their customers.

				{/*TODO I cannot figure out what is going on in the below sentence after "hardware and" */}
				<p>
					The previous support company (which they were paying a
					substantial amount per month) now wanted a large amount to
					replace the hardware and reinforcing the service let down
					they were not even aware of the years of problems being
					reported before the fall over.
				</p>
				<p>
					{/* TODO from "Setting up and implementing a VPN" this needs to be spaced out a bit - 
					feels like paragraph transitions to bullet points not sentences */}
					We were able to supply and install a number of Macs with
					upgraded hard drives and max RAM to run their massive
					spreadsheets and technical documents. Replacing their Domain
					controller with a Mac running macOS Server gave them
					visibility of their backups and data use, and allowed cloud
					backups. Setting up and implementing a VPN for work from
					home staff. Continuing support over the years for small
					niggles and eventually upgrades 5 years later.

				{/* "The kids were learning and so speed is not a bottleneck." - don't understand this sentence, is it meant to sat it was a bottleneck.  
				If not, probably just replace it with things that actually were problems... */}
				<p>
					A customer called about a single project, replacing the hard
					drives on more than 20 iMac 2012 computers. These did
					everything the school needed as they were used for entry
					level lessons in Logic, Garageband and Motion. The kids were
					learning and so speed is not a bottleneck. These were imaged
					each term as the classes moved around, but the hard drives
					were starting to fail and so the imaging was taking longer
					and longer, and the Macs were getting less use as they were
					frustrating everyone taking 5 mins to boot at the start of a
					lesson.
				</p>
				<p>
					These were completed in 3 days onsite. We replaced the hard
					drives with small SSDs. This reduced their boot times to 10
					seconds, making the machines excellent tools for the
					students needs.
