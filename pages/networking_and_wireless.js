					To many people, networks are 'Magic' - they just kinda work;
					they follow rules which no one really understands, and use
					numbers which make no sense - they just add the subnet mask
					because the last IT Guy said that was what it was.. And so
					it shall be. So many networks are still going through the
					ISP provided router with no data visibility, no control over
					"bandwidth vampires" and no understanding of what is causing
					those slowdowns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Modern business class networking is a complex beast. Gone
					are the days of just plugging in a couple of switches and
					everything works. You need to think about bottlenecks and
					where your data flows, and having a 100 MegaBit leased line
					(which you upgraded just last year as everyone said the
					internet was slow) running from a 10 year old DrayTek router
					is just never going to deliver... but so many small
					businesses do it because it <em>is</em> working, and they
					don't want to touch it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disappointingly most Internet service providers wipe their
					hands of any issues beyond their cable (or ask for massive
					amounts of money to give you the same answer - everything is
					working fine as far as they are concerned) and that is where
					so many just grab an old switch, or the router they used a
					couple of years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					You need to understand how to design a network to ensure
					that the services that need the bandwidth are given what
					they need, and to think about how your users interact with
					it all.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can work with you on-site to setup a fast, reliable WiFi
					network which covers everywhere you need. We can configure
					different networks to allow staff to use the internet and
					not interfere with business critical systems - no more
					Netflix stopping the lunchtime off-site backup from
					completing!
				</p>
				<p>
					Our 'goto' networking brand of choice is Ubiquiti - we've
					found their range to be scalable, reliable, and good value.
				</p>
				<p>
					We've installed and maintained small and simple networks,
					and large multisite networks with dedicated leased lines and
					point to point connectivity. Why not get in touch to see how
					we can make your network work for you again.
